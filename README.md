# CSS Polyfill

Make CSS do more by defining simple DOM manipulations instead of ad-hoc JavaScript.

# Development

Make sure `bower` and `grunt` are installed in the system by running `npm install -g bower grunt`.
Then run:

    bower install

    git clone https://github.com/less/less.js

    cd less.js
    npm install
    grunt browser

    cd ..

    # Verify less.js/test/browser/less.js exists
